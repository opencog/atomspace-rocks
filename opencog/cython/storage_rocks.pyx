# storage_rocks.pyx
#
# Defines a python module for the RocksDB storage nodes.
# There's almost nothing here, just enough to link the C library to 
# cython so that user can import. Intended use is for the user to say
#
# import storage_rocks
#
# and that's all.

from opencog.atomspace import types

# Great emptiness.
