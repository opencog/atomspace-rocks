;
; Clear the local AtomSpace (the Atoms remain on disk, just not in RAM).
; This removes the Atom from the AtomSpace, but it remains live, because
; the scheme smob 'rsn' still points to it.
(cog-atomspace-clear)

; In addition to 'rsn' pointing at the Atom, the persist module retains
; a global pointer to the current (still open!) StorageNode. To close,
; two things must happen:
; (1) decrement the Atom use count by one, by clobbering the AtomPtr
;     in the scheme smob rsn
; (2) decrement the Atom use count by one, by clobbering the AtomPtr
;     in the persist module.
; Only after both happen (so that the use count goes to zero), will the
; StorageNode dtor run, closing the connection.
;
; Step (2) happens when the (cog-open) below is called. But that leaves
; the use count at one, and so the DB connection remains open, and this
; second open segfaults, because the DB lock is still held. So we have
; to also force (1) to happen. There are two ways to do this:
; (a) Make opencog/guile print the smob. Since opencog/guile does not
;     allow Atoms not in any AtomSpace, the AtomPtr gets clobbered.
; (b) (set! rsn #f) and run (gc) to force the AtomPtr to be gc'ed.
;
; Either (a) or (b) will work. We chose (a) for this test.
;
; So, some tests.
; First: Is rsn an atom? Yes, it still is.
(test-equal #t (cog-atom? rsn))

; Next, is it in this AtomSpace? No it isn't.
(test-equal #f (cog-atom rsn))

; Accessing it from guile will clobber the guile smob pointer.
; If we don't do this, rsn will remain live. The define, further
; below, will not clobber it, but only release it. A round of gc's
; would be needed for the actual release. Blech. Either will work.
(format #t "The rsn right now is: ~A\n" rsn)

; The above clobber means the guile rsn smob no longer points
; to an Atom.  There is still a global pointer to it, in the
; persist module, and so the destrcuctor has not yet run. The
; use-count on the thing is now one. It will drop to zero, when
; the cog-open below clobbers the old global pointer.
